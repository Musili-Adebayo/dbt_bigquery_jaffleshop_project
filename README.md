##  Project Summary
This project involves connecting dbt Cloud with BigQuery for analytical/BI end users. Below are the step carried out.

## The Prerequisite for this project is
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
2. Create a dbt cloud account.

+ The Dataset used was the popular dbt dataset called jaffleshop, available on Google Cloud Public dataset.

1. Getting started: Firstly, I created a project dataset in Google Cloud and connect with dbt via the GCP service account key. You can also set up a managed repository in dbt, but I use my gitup account for version control.

2. Leveraging the popular dbt naming and i build my first model that connect data from source to staging (performing some transformation) testing and documenting my job.
