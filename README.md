##  Project Summary
This project involves connecting dbt Cloud with BigQuery for analytical/BI end users. Below are the step carried out.

## Prerequisite for this project is
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
2. Create a dbt cloud account.

## Dataset used was the popular dbt dataset called jaffleshop available on google cloud public dataset.

1. Getting started: Firstly, i created a project datatset in google cloud and connect with dbt via the GCP service account key. You can also set up a managed repository in dbt, but i use my gitup account for version control.

2. Leveraging the popular dbt naming and i build my first model that connect data from source to staging (performing some transformation) testing and documenting my job.
